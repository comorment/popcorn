``EUR_EAS_all_gen_eff.cscore  EUR_EAS_all_gen_imp.cscore`` - Pre-computed scores for EUR and EAS 1000 genomes populations downloaded from  [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/37n7drt7q4sjrzn/AAAa1HFeeRAE5M3YWG9Ac2Bta), then unpacked. I actually don't know what is the difference between the two files (eff vs imp)

``1000GP_Phase3.sample`` -- Text file that originates from [here](https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/1000GP_Phase3.html), with sample ID, population and continental group for the individuals in the haplotype files
